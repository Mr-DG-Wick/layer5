### The Story

Open source and community first: Layer5 has been espousing this ideology ever since it was founded. 
Having established industry standards and enabled service developers, owners, and operators with 
repeatable patterns and best practices for managing all aspects of distributed services, it fills 
us with enthusiasm to see how a thousand Meshy heads have come to appreciate Meshery.

The thousand stars on Meshery’s repository sheds light on how Meshery and the community are 
steadfastly moving in the unerring direction which it initially set for itself.

This feat wouldn’t have been possible without the valuable contributions of our contributors, maintainers 
and community members. Thank you for making it possible!

#### Awesome! But what is Meshery?

A very valid question one may raise, follow along. Meshery is the service mesh management plane, or to be more 
precise, the extensible service mesh manager. You can adopt and operate any service mesh with 
confidence using Meshery's management features.

Meshery helps you assess the value of your service mesh in context of its cost. It helps benchmark and manage 
the performance of your application across different service meshes and assists you in comparing and managing 
service mesh overhead. But when we say Meshery, it's all about our users, so let's hear what some of our users have to say.

“ Meshery helps us curate Service Mesh for tailored needs by helping us run simulations and identifying the right fit 
Service Mesh that works efficiently across a diverse ecosystem of tools ” ~ quotes Yogi Porla, Principal Engineer at HPE.

Shane W, a DevOps Architect says “ the ability to benchmark Istio in MY cluster with MY workloads is just what I was 
looking for. I threw out my test scripts ”

In the entirety of Meshery, it comprises 20+ repositories which collectively have seen more than a whopping 2K Pull Requests 
being merged, more than 11K commits by 400+ contributors leading to a massive 30K contributions at the time of writing 
this blog post. Promising as it sounds, you can see the stats for further analysis at 
[Devstats](https://meshery.devstats.cncf.io/d/8/dashboards?orgId=1&refresh=15m).

Now you may have a fair idea of what Meshery is and what it brings to the table for its users. You can always visit the 
[Meshery website](https://meshery.io/) to learn more about all things Meshery.

#### What lies ahead in the future?

" Diverse microservices patterns and technologies, together with the requirements of given microservice applications, 
provide myriad opportunities for service mesh differentiation and specialization - including meshes native to specific 
cloud platforms. This will lead to a world where many enterprises use multiple service mesh products, whether separately 
or together. "  - an excerpt from the book, 
[The Enterprise Path to Service Mesh Architectures](https://layer5.io/learn/service-mesh-books/the-enterprise-path-to-service-mesh-architectures-2nd-edition) 
by Lee Calcote.

With the recent adoption of Meshery by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ( read more about it 
[here](https://layer5.io/company/news/cncf-adopts-meshery-the-service-mesh-management-plane) ), the community 
is steadfast in making Meshery the best version of itself. With continuous improvements in the architecture, user 
experience and in other fields regulated by inclusive monitoring, Meshery is bound to grow.

#### What makes the Layer5 community unique?

The [Layer5 community](https://layer5.io/community) is growing at a tremendous rate. We value our connections and that is what makes us unique. With 
the backing of a strong multicultural community across the globe, every Layer5 open-source contributor brings something 
unique to the table. Each contributor espouses our cultural values of inclusivity and pays it forward to others. 
We welcome individuals at all stages of development and from all walks of life.

Here, we build projects to provide learning environments, help each other learn about deployment and operational 
best practices, performance benchmarks, collaborate on documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. 
It is our shared commitment to the open source spirit that pushes Layer5 projects forward.

Talking about uniqueness, here’s a great [talk](https://youtu.be/0yN5T5LB9ps) you’d like. Checkout Layer5’s 
[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Layer5io) channel to stay updated with more such great talks, Keynotes and more!

**Stay Meshy!**
